# tree-sitter-slim

[Slim](http://slim-lang.com/) template grammar for
[tree-sitter](https://tree-sitter.github.io/).

Based on guesswork, as there's no description of slim grammar;
[parser](https://github.com/slim-template/slim/blob/master/lib/slim/parser.rb)
should be a primary source of truth, but it's too hard to understand
at this stage of development.

Completeness: just started, nothing works.
